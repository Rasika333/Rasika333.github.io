              Jerome David Salinger was an American writer best known for his 1951 novel
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Catcher_in_the_Rye">
              <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>.</a>Before its publication, Salinger published several
              short stories in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_(magazine)">Story</a> magazine and served in World War II.
              Among other accomplishments, he takes part in the Battle of the Bulge and, later, enters Kaufering, a sub-camp of Dachau.
              He also forges a strong friendship with war correspondent Ernest Hemingway. Salinger continues his writing career
              during the war, carting his typewriter around in his Jeep.
              In 1948, his critically acclaimed story <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Perfect_Day_for_Bananafish">A Perfect Day for Bananafish</a>
              appeared in The New Yorker, which published much of his later work.

              Regarding "<i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>", Salinger's depiction of adolescent alienation
              and loss of innocence in the protagonist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holden_Caulfield">Holden Caulfield</a> was influential, especially
              among adolescent readers.The novel was widely read and controversial,and its success
              led to public attention and scrutiny.The Catcher in the Rye has a legacy of the most
              censored as well as the most taught book in schools with sales reaching over 60 million.
               The novel also deals with complex issues of innocence, identity, belonging, loss, connection,
              sex, and depression.
              Salinger received (and rejected) numerous offers to adapt The Catcher in the Rye for
              the screen, including one from Samuel Goldwyn.His ex-girlfriend commented that Salinger
              himself would be fit to play Holden Caulfield.
              The infamy towards the novel became larger as it was revealed that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_David_Chapman">man</a> who shot John Lennon read Salinger's
              book and was obsessed with Caulfield.
